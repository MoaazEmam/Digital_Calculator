This repo contains 8 files. 3 of the ".v" files are for the 4 operations (addition, subtraction, remainder, multiplication) along with 3 testbench files for the operations.
The fourth ".v" file is for the ALU where you pick an operation, input 2 3-bit signed numbers and get the result along with a sign flag, zero flag and division by zero flag (for remainder). 
A testbench is also available for the ALU, although, as is it only outputs certain testcases that were required from us while submitting the project. 
This project was worked on by 3 students including myself for a Logic Design course and was implemented as hardware.
